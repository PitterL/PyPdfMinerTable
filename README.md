[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pdfminer/pdfminer.six.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pdfminer/pdfminer.six) [![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pdfminer.six.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfminer.six/)

PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting
and analyzing text data. PDFMiner allows one to obtain
the exact location of text in a page, as well as
other information such as fonts or lines.
It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files
into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible
PDF parser that can be used for other purposes than text analysis.
